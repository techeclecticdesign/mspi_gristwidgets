# ðŸ“¦ Maine State Prison Industries - Custom Grist Widgets

This repository contains the custom widget components developed for the Maine State Prison Industries system. The overall project was designed to modernize the way payroll, employment, production, inventory, and shipping data is managed within the facility.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

This project was developed with the following requirements in mind:

- âœ… Use of **modern tools and technologies**
- âœ… Ability to run entirely on a **LAN**, with **no internet access**
- âœ… Provide a **user-friendly, non-programmer interface** for data interaction, similar to Microsoft Access and Excel
- âœ… Include **custom software** capable of handling **complex business logic** and offering **intuitive user interfaces** comparable to the legacy system

## ðŸ’¡ Solution Overview

To meet these criteria, **Grist** was chosen as the backbone of the system. Grist serves both as the **data backend** and a **low-code/no-code interface** for non-technical users, enabling smooth interaction with structured data without the need for external internet connectivity.

This repository focuses on the **custom Grist widgets** created to extend Gristâ€™s functionality. These widgets implement business-specific logic and offer a streamlined interface tailored to the workflows of the **woodshop clerks** within the facility.
